Cover the entire selected year.

Below the chart, include mathematical calculations such as:

Variance (budget – spending)

Percentage of budget used

Report 2 – Monthly Savings and Expense Breakdown

Provide a detailed breakdown by category, showing:

Each category’s budget

Use charts where applicable (e.g., pie chart for category spending distribution, bar chart for savings vs expenses).

General Requirements:

Charts should be clear, visually appealing, and easy to interpret.

Ensure all calculations are accurate and displayed with proper labels and units (e.g., currency format).
